# NBA Points Prediction Model

## Overview

Welcome to the NBA Points Prediction Model repository! This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the points per game (PPG) of NBA players. The goal is to provide insights and predictive capabilities for player performance based on historical data.

## Features

- **Data Visualization:** Interactive and informative plots to visualize player statistics.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementation of predictive models to forecast player performance.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt the model and visualizations for different datasets or prediction goals.

## Repository Structure

- **NBA Points Prediction Model.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and model implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `sklearn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
